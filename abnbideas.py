                'Help me understand this product:\nPrecise IP data via a user-friendly API, encompassing geolocation, ASN data, hosting detection, VPN detection, and proxy detection\nAbout\nPricing\nBlog\nDocumentation\nIP Databases\nGitHub\nLog In\nStart\n\nIntroduction\nQuickstart\nData Sources\nAPI Servers\nAPI Features\nAPI Response Format\n\nAPI Response Format\n Top Level API Output\nThe datacenter object\nThe company object\nThe abuse object\nThe asn object\nThe location object\nAPI Endpoints\n\nGET Endpoint\nPOST Endpoint\nDatabases\n\nIP Databases\nDocumentation\n Page last updated on July 22, 2024\n Please always use the following API endpoint api.ipapi.is\nLookup any IP address with: api.ipapi.is/?q=52.46.64.223\nLookup any ASN: api.ipapi.is/?q=as20880\nipapi.is provides useful meta-information for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. For example, the API response includes the organization associated with the IP address, ASN meta-data, geolocation intelligence, and the raw WHOIS data for the IP address.\n\nFurthermore, the API response enables the derivation of security information for each IP address. For instance, it indicates whether an IP address belongs to:\n\na hosting provider (is_datacenter)\nis a TOR exit node (is_tor)\nif an IP address is a proxy server exit node (socks4, socks5, or http proxy) (is_proxy)\nis a VPN exit node (is_vpn)\nor is linked to an IP address that has engaged in abusive actions (is_abuser)\nThe API places a strong emphasis on hosting detection. A sophisticated hosting detection algorithm has been developed to achieve a high detection rate. Thousands of different hosting providers around the globe are tracked. WHOIS records, public IP ranges from hosting providers, and a proprietary hosting discovery algorithm are used to determine whether an IP address belongs to a hosting provider.\n\nipapi.is claims to possess the most effective hosting detection algorithm in the IP address provider space. This success is primarily due to the process of downloading and analyzing websites of all major organizations that own IP addresses on the Internet.\n\nipapi.is also includes accurate and comprehensive ASN meta-data. The API includes raw WHOIS data for each active ASN. API fields such as the type field included in the company or asn output object are determined by analyzing the company (organization) that owns the autonomous system or IP range. ipapi.is differentiates between the following company (organization) types:\n\nhosting - The ASN or network is owned by a hosting provider (Example: 37.148.167.137)\neducation - The ASN or network is affiliated with a university or another educational institution (Example: 128.146.65.112)\ngovernment - The ASN or network is part of a governmental institution (Example: 192.91.184.0)\nbanking - The ASN or network is associated with a banking or financial institution (Example: 199.67.175.0)\nisp - The ASN or network belongs to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) (Example: 108.15.237.36)\nbusiness - If the type does not fit any of the above categories, it is classified under the generic business type (Example: 17.133.85.230)\n# Quickstart\nIn order to lookup any IP address, use the following API endpoint: https://api.ipapi.is?q=3.5.140.2\n\nLookup your own IP address by omitting the query string (no q parameter): https://api.ipapi.is\n\nUsage with JavaScript:\n\nfetch(\'https://api.ipapi.is?q=23.236.48.55\')\n  .then(res => res.json())\n  .then(res => console.log(res));\nUsage with NodeJS:\n\nconst https = require(\'https\');\n\nconst apiRequest = (ip, apiKey = \'\') => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const url = `https://api.ipapi.is/?q=${ip}${apiKey ? `&key=${apiKey}` : \'\'}`;\n\n    https.get(url, (res) => {\n      let data = \'\';\n\n      res.on(\'data\', (chunk) => {\n        data += chunk;\n      });\n\n      res.on(\'end\', () => {\n        try {\n          const parsedData = JSON.parse(data);\n          resolve(parsedData);\n        } catch (err) {\n          reject(new Error(\'Error parsing JSON: \' + err.message));\n        }\n      });\n\n    }).on(\'error\', (err) => {\n      reject(new Error(\'Error: \' + err.message));\n    });\n  });\n};\n\napiRequest(\'32.43.11.44\')\n  .then(console.log)\n  .catch(console.error);\nUsage with curl:\n\ncurl \'https://api.ipapi.is?q=32.5.140.2\'\n# Data Sources\nipapi.is utilizes the following sources for API data:\n\nPublic WHOIS records from Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) such as RIPE NCC, APNIC, and ARIN. For privacy reasons, the public and downloadable WHOIS databases from the five RIRs are often incomplete. Therefore, millions of IP ranges and ASNs are periodically queried with a whois client to keep ipapi.is up-to-date.\nPublic BGP routing table data is used to source ASN data and to obtain the routes (prefixes) for active ASN.\nPublic IP blocklists, such as firehol/blocklist-ipset and stamparm/ipsum, are used to identify the is_abuser flag.\nThe API employs a proprietary datacenter/hosting detection algorithm. Accurate hosting detection is achieved by aggregating data from many different sources, including:\nManually labeling organizations as hosting providers (inefficient)\nAutomatically labeling organizations as hosting providers based on the organization name, domain, website content, and HTML meta tags (efficient, but with a high rate of false positives and requiring scraping/crawling of millions of organization websites)\nUsing self-published IP ranges from major cloud providers such as:\nGoogle Cloud IP Ranges\nMicrosoft Azure IP Ranges\nAmazon AWS IP ranges\nConsidering open-source projects that identify hosting IP addresses, such as github.com/client9/ipcat, github.com/Umkus/ip-index, or github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn\nThe API leverages IP threat data from various public honeypots and a own honeypot server network.\nA proprietary geolocation database was developed from scratch. Geolocation data is primarily sourced from WHOIS data. For instance, some Regional Internet Registries like APNIC support the geofeed and geoloc properties in WHOIS records. RIPE NCC also supports the geoloc attribute as of 2016.\n# API Servers\nipapi.is is currently operational in four different geographical locations:\n\nServer in Germany: https://de.ipapi.is/?q=104.28.64.25\nServer in US East: https://us.ipapi.is/?q=104.28.64.25\nServer in US West: https://us-west.ipapi.is/?q=104.28.64.25\nServer in Singapore (Asia): https://sg.ipapi.is/?q=15.220.195.253\nThere is no significant benefit to using these dedicated server endpoints directly. Instead, by utilizing the endpoint https://api.ipapi.is/, the nearest server (in terms of latency) is automatically selected.\n\n# API Features\nReady for Production: This API is stable and suitable for production use. Currently, ipapi.is operates from four different geographical locations (Germany, US East, US West, Singapore) to minimize end-user latency. The API can handle millions of daily requests and is updated at least once a week.\nAccuracy: The most reliable IP Address data comes from WHOIS data provided by Regional Internet Registries like RIPE NCC or ARIN. Consequently, ipapi.is prioritizes a WHOIS-first approach. IP data from third-party providers is considered less reliable.\nExtensive Hosting Detection Support: Thousands of hosting providers are supported, ranging from "Huawei Cloud Service" to "ServerMania Inc". You can determine if an IP address is hosted using the is_datacenter field in the API output!\nAlways Updated: The API database is automatically updated at least weekly.\nASN Support: The API provides autonomous system information for each IP address queried.\nCompany Support: The API offers organizational information for each IP address looked up.\nBulk IP Lookups: Query up to 100 IP addresses per API call.\nOffline API Usage (Download): Download the complete ipapi.is package and host it on your own infrastructure. Visit the pricing page for more details.\n# API Response Format\nThe API output format is explained best by walking through an example. Most of the returned API output information is self-explanatory.\n\nThe API example lookup below is how a typical API response looks like. The IP 107.174.138.172 was queried with the API call https://api.ipapi.is?q=107.174.138.172:\n\n{\n  "ip": "107.174.138.172",\n  "rir": "ARIN",\n  "is_bogon": false,\n  "is_mobile": false,\n  "is_crawler": false,\n  "is_datacenter": true,\n  "is_tor": true,\n  "is_proxy": true,\n  "is_vpn": true,\n  "is_abuser": true,\n  "company": {\n    "name": "HostPapa",\n    "abuser_score": "0.0054 (Low)",\n    "domain": "www.hostpapa.com",\n    "type": "hosting",\n    "network": "107.172.0.0 - 107.175.255.255",\n    "whois": "https://api.ipapi.is/?whois=107.172.0.0"\n  },\n  "abuse": {\n    "name": "HostPapa",\n    "address": "Buffalo, NY, 14202, US",\n    "country": "US",\n    "email": "net-abuse-global@hostpapa.com",\n    "phone": "+1-905-315-3455"\n  },\n  "datacenter": {\n    "datacenter": "HostPapa",\n    "network": "107.174.138.0/24",\n    "country": "US",\n    "region": "US-NY",\n    "city": "Buffalo"\n  },\n  "asn": {\n    "asn": 36352,\n    "abuser_score": "0.0033 (Low)",\n    "route": "107.174.138.0/24",\n    "descr": "AS-COLOCROSSING, US",\n    "country": "us",\n    "active": true,\n    "org": "HostPapa",\n    "domain": "www.hostpapa.com",\n    "abuse": "net-abuse-global@hostpapa.com",\n    "type": "hosting",\n    "created": "2005-12-12",\n    "updated": "2024-01-04",\n    "rir": "ARIN",\n    "whois": "https://api.ipapi.is/?whois=AS36352"\n  },\n  "location": {\n    "continent": "NA",\n    "country": "United States",\n    "country_code": "US",\n    "state": "New York",\n    "city": "Buffalo",\n    "latitude": 42.88645,\n    "longitude": -78.87837,\n    "zip": "14205",\n    "timezone": "America/New_York",\n    "local_time": "2024-05-23T09:38:38-04:00",\n    "local_time_unix": 1716471518,\n    "is_dst": true,\n    "accuracy": 1\n  },\n  "elapsed_ms": 0.48\n}\nIn the following sections, the different parts of the API response are explained in-depth.\n\nIn general, the API output can be divided into several distinctive parts:\n\nTop-Level API Output - This provides generic output and threat intelligence information for the queried IP address.\nThe datacenter object - Present only if the queried IP address belongs to a hosting provider, the datacenter object contains meta information about the hosting provider or datacenter.\nThe company object - Most IP addresses are associated with an organization or company. The company object contains meta information about the organization that owns or has administrative control over the queried IP address.\nThe asn object - Most IP addresses are part of an Autonomous System (AS). The asn object provides meta information about the Autonomous System.\nThe location object - Often, it is possible to geolocate IP addresses. The location object includes geographical information for the queried IP address, indicating the part of the world where the IP address is used.\n# Top Level API Output\nThe top level API output looks as follows for the IP address 107.174.138.172:\n\n{\n  "ip": "107.174.138.172",\n  "rir": "ARIN",\n  "is_bogon": false,\n  "is_mobile": false,\n  "is_crawler": false,\n  "is_datacenter": true,\n  "is_tor": true,\n  "is_proxy": true,\n  "is_vpn": false,\n  "is_abuser": true,\n}\nThe explanation for the top-level API fields is as follows:\n\n# ip - The API query\nThe field ip has the datatype string.\n\nThis field represents the IP address that was looked up. In the example above, it was 107.174.138.172.\n\nIf no IP address was specified (Example: https://api.ipapi.is), the client\'s own IP address is looked up, and the field ip is set to the client\'s public IP address.\n\n# rir - The Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for this IP\nThe field rir has the datatype string.\n\nIt specifies which Regional Internet Registry (RIR) the IP address belongs to. Here, it belongs to ARIN, which is the RIR responsible for North America. In total, there are five different RIRs for various areas of the world:\n\n\nFigure 1: The five different Regional Internet Registries (Source)\n# is_bogon - Whether the IP is bogon (non-routable)\nThe field is_bogon has the datatype boolean.\n\nIt determines if the IP address is bogon. Bogon IP Addresses are those not assigned or allocated by IANA or any RIR (Regional Internet Registry). For example, the loopback IP 127.0.0.1 is a special/bogon IP address. The IP address 107.174.138.172 is not bogon, hence it is set to false in this case.\n\nGenerally, there is no good reason to query bogon IP addresses, as they are local or special IP addresses that exist in every local network and have no unique significance on the Internet.\n\n# is_mobile - Whether the IP is mobile (belongs to a mobile ISP)\nThe field is_mobile has the datatype boolean.\n\nIt determines if the IP address belongs to a mobile Internet Service Provider, such as AT&T Wireless or T-Mobile. Knowing whether an IP address belongs to a mobile ISP is often crucial for security purposes.\n\nFor example, Carrier-grade NATs are commonly used in mobile networks, meaning many distinct clients can share the same public IP address. Therefore, rate limiting or banning mobile IP addresses is not advisable, as it could also block legitimate clients sharing the same mobile public IP address.\n\nOther reasons for identifying if an IP originates from a mobile ISP include:\n\nCertain services being exclusively accessible to mobile clients\nAnticipating reduced Internet speed often associated with mobile clients\nThe IP address 107.174.138.172 does not belong to a mobile ISP, hence it is set to false in this instance.\n\nAs of February 2024, the API does not fully detect all mobile IP ranges. The mobile coverage is not good, but the false positive rate is rather low.\n\n# is_crawler - Whether the IP belongs to a crawler / spider / good bot\nThe field is_crawler is either set to false or, if the IP belongs to a crawler, it is set to a string such as "GoogleBot" or "BingBot".\n\nSome Examples:\n\nTwitterBot - 199.59.148.0\nGoogleBot - 66.249.70.224\nBingBot - 40.77.190.180\nDuckduckgoBot - 40.76.173.151\nYandexBot - 213.180.203.183\nThis field can be used to check whether the IP address belongs to a search engine crawler / bot that you might want to allow on your website or app. Currently, the following crawlers / good bots are detected:\n\n# is_datacenter - Whether the IP belongs to a Hosting Provider\nThe field is_datacenter has the datatype boolean.\n\nIt specifies whether the IP address belongs to a datacenter (hosting provider) or not. In this example, the value is true, since 107.174.138.172 belongs to the hosting provider ColoCrossing.\n\nThe definition of what constitutes a datacenter (hosting provider) is quite lenient on ipapi.is and includes all of the following categories:\n\nStandard hosting providers such as Hetzner.de or Leaseweb.com\nLarge cloud providers such as Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure\nContent Delivery Networks such as Cloudflare, Fastly or edg.io\nAnti-DDoS services such as qrator.net or ddos-guard.net\nIP leasing organizations such as ipxo.com or interlir.com\nOther SaaS, IaaS, or PaaS organizations such as fly.io or Heroku\nIn other words, every organization that allows third parties to quickly and anonymously obtain hosting resources or access to IP addresses is considered a hosting provider.\n\nIf the IP address belongs to a datacenter, then the datacenter object will also be present in the API output.\n\nThe datacenter/hosting detection quality of ipapi.is is one of its core strengths. If this value is true, you can rely on the fact that the IP address belongs to a hosting provider.\n\nFor a full list of hosting providers, click on the button below.\n\n# is_tor - Whether the IP is a TOR Exit Node\nThe field is_tor has the datatype boolean.\n\nIf the field is_tor is true, the IP address is a TOR exit node. TOR exit node detection is very accurate, so you can rely on the value of is_tor. The API detects most TOR exit nodes reliably.\n\nIf the is_tor field is true, it is recommended to either challenge the client with this IP address with a captcha or block them from accessing critical resources.\n\nThis is because the TOR network is often used by cybercriminals for malicious activities, and if you are running a critical service, you might want to prevent TOR clients from accessing it.\n\n# is_proxy - Whether the IP is a Proxy Exit Node\nThe field is_proxy has the datatype boolean.\n\nThe field determines whether the IP address is a proxy. In this example, the IP https://api.ipapi.is/?q=107.174.138.172 is a proxy. Generally, the flag is_proxy only covers a subset of all proxies on the Internet. In other words, ipapi.is cannot reliably detect residential and mobile proxies.\n\nProxy and VPN detection that follows an offline-based approach is not very accurate. Why is that the case? The following example explains why there is a limit to the accuracy that can be achieved:\n\n Let\'s assume a threat actor sets up a proxy server on a cheap hosting instance and starts using the proxy server for nefarious use cases. How can any offline proxy database contain the information immediately that this IP address belongs to a proxy server?\n\nThe answer is: Offline databases cannot know this. The only reliable way to detect proxies and VPNs is to observe their networking behavior when they are actually used (live).\n\nProxy databases can only be populated over time, after the threat actor has used the proxy server repeatedly on websites or honeypots. Therefore, these proxy databases are often outdated, lag behind, or contain false information.\n\nNevertheless, ipapi.is strives to be as accurate as possible by using many different sources that publish proxy IP addresses. Example source: firehol_anonymous.netset from the FireHOL project.\n\n# is_vpn - Whether the IP is a VPN Exit Node\nThe field is_vpn determines whether the IP address is a VPN Exit Node and has datatype boolean or string.\n\nThe is_vpn field can have two different data types, depending on whether the specific VPN service can be detected or not. To give some examples:\n\nboolean (false) - 67.170.172.12 is not associated with an VPN, therefore the field is_vpn is set to false\nstring ("Mullvad") - 146.70.128.244 belongs to the VPN service Mullvad, therefore the field is_vpn is set to the string value "Mullvad"\nboolean (true) -The IP 172.240.248.0 is known to be a VPN exit node, but it is not known to which service specifically. Therefore the field is_vpn is set to the generic truthy value true\nThe field is_vpn covers a constantly growing subset of all VPNs on the Internet. Due to our systematic approach to finding VPN exit nodes, the VPN coverage of the API is constantly growing and becoming more accurate on a daily basis.\n\n# is_abuser - Whether the IP committed abusive actions\nThe field is_abuser has the datatype boolean.\n\nThe field is_abuser is true if the IP address has committed abusive actions, as was the case with 107.174.138.172. Various IP blocklists and threat intelligence feeds are used to populate the is_abuser flag.\n\nOpen source and proprietary blocklists are used in the API to populate the is_abuser flag. The flag does not differentiate the type of abusive action; the IP could have been involved in activities like viruses, bots, crawlers, scrapers, or worms.\n\nIf the is_abuser attribute is true, it is advisable to either challenge the client with this IP address with a captcha or block them from accessing critical resources.\n\nExample data source for abusive IP addresses: firehol_abusers_1d.netset\n\n# elapsed_ms - The internal processing time for the API lookup\nThe field elapsed_ms has the datatype float.\n\nThis field indicates the amount of internal processing time, measured in milliseconds (ms), spent handling the API query. This particular lookup took only 0.9ms, which is quite fast.\n\nOn average, IP lookups on ipapi.is take about 1.2ms of processing time.\n\n# The datacenter object\nExample API output for the datacenter object:\n\n"datacenter": {\n  "datacenter": "HostPapa",\n  "domain": "www.hostpapa.com",\n  "network": "107.172.0.0 - 107.175.255.255"\n}\nIf the IP address belongs to a datacenter/hosting provider, the API response will include a datacenter object with at least the following attributes:\n\ndatacenter - string - to which datacenter the IP address belongs. For a full list of datacenters, check the hosting providers table page. In this case, the datacenter\'s name is HostPapa.\ndomain - string - The domain name of the hosting provider company\nnetwork - string - the network this IP address belongs to (In the above case: 107.172.0.0 - 107.175.255.255)\nMost IP\'s don\'t belong to a hosting provider. In those cases, the datacenter object will not be present in the API output.\n\nFor a couple of large cloud providers, such as Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, DigitalOcean or Microsoft Azure (and many others), the datacenter object is more detailed.\n\nAmazon AWS example:\n\n{\n  "ip": "3.5.140.2",\n  "datacenter": {\n    "datacenter": "Amazon AWS",\n    "network": "3.5.140.0/22",\n    "region": "ap-northeast-2",\n    "service": "EC2",\n    "network_border_group": "ap-northeast-2"\n  }\n}\nDigitalOcean example:\n\n{\n  "ip": "167.99.241.130",\n  "datacenter": {\n    "datacenter": "DigitalOcean",\n    "code": "60341",\n    "city": "Frankfurt",\n    "state": "DE-HE",\n    "country": "DE",\n    "network": "167.99.240.0/20"\n  },\n}\nLinode example:\n\n{\n  "ip": "72.14.182.54",\n  "datacenter": {\n    "datacenter": "Linode",\n    "name": "US-TX",\n    "city": "Richardson",\n    "country": "US",\n    "network": "72.14.182.0/24"\n  },\n}\n# The company object\nExample API output for the company object:\n\n"company": {\n  "name": "HostPapa",\n  "abuser_score": "0.0062 (Low)",\n  "domain": "www.hostpapa.com",\n  "type": "hosting",\n  "network": "107.172.0.0 - 107.175.255.255",\n  "whois": "https://api.ipapi.is/?whois=107.172.0.0"\n},\nMost IP addresses can be associated with an organization or company. The API uses WHOIS information to infer which organization is the administrative owner of a certain IP address.\n\nThe owner of an IP address is stored in the databases of the five Regional Internet Registies (RIR\'rs). For example, IP address ownership in RIPE NCC is handled with inetnum (IPv4) and inet6num (IPv6) objects. In ARIN, IP address ownership can be inferred from NetRange objects.\n\nSince the example IP 107.174.138.172 falls into the administrative realm of ARIN, the corresponding WHOIS record is obtained with whois -h whois.arin.net 107.174.138.172 and yields:\n\nThe company object is sourced from inetnum or NetRange WHOIS objects. The OrgName from the WHOIS record above is mapped to the name attribute of the the company object.\n\nMost API lookups will have an company object with the following attributes:\n\nname - string - The name of the organization (company) obtained from the corresponding WHOIS database entry\nabuser_score - string - This field represents the quota of abusive IP addresses of the network belonging to the organization (company). The higher this number is, the more abusive the whole network is.\ndomain - string - The domain name of the organization (company)\ntype - string - The type for this organization (company), this is either hosting, education, government, banking, business or isp\nnetwork - string - The network for which the organization (company) has ownership\nwhois - string - An url to the WHOIS record for the network of this IP address\n# The abuse object\nExample API output for the abuse object:\n\n"abuse": {\n  "name": "HostPapa",\n  "address": "Buffalo, NY, 14202, US",\n  "country": "US",\n  "email": "net-abuse-global@hostpapa.com",\n  "phone": "+1-905-315-3455"\n},\nThe abuse object contains abuse information about the organization that owns the queried IP address.\n\nMost IP addresses can be associated with an organization or company. The API uses WHOIS information to determine which organization is the administrative owner of the queried IP address.\n\nThe data provided in the abuse object helps to get in touch by phone or email with the organization responsible for a certain IP network.\n\nThe abuse data always refers to the same network specified in the company.network field.\n\nMost API lookups will include an abuse object with the following attributes:\n\nname - string - The abuse contact name, the name of the individual or entity that receives abuse complaints about the network specified in company.network.\naddress - string - The abuse contact address. This is the physical address of the abuse contact for the entity that owns the network specified in company.network.\ncountry - string - The country in which the abuse contact resides.\nemail - string - The abuse contact email. This email address handles abuse complaints about incidents associated with the network specified in company.network.\nphone - string - The abuse contact phone number. This phone number handles abuse complaints about incidents associated with the network specified in company.network.\n# The asn object\nExample API output for the asn object:\n\n"asn": {\n  "asn": 36352,\n  "abuser_score": "0.0071 (Low)",\n  "route": "107.174.138.0/24",\n  "descr": "AS-COLOCROSSING, CA",\n  "country": "ca",\n  "active": true,\n  "org": "ColoCrossing",\n  "domain": "www.colocrossing.com",\n  "abuse": "abuse@colocrossing.com",\n  "type": "hosting",\n  "created": "2005-12-12",\n  "updated": "2013-01-08",\n  "rir": "ARIN",\n  "whois": "https://api.ipapi.is/?whois=AS36352"\n},\nMost IP addresses can be associated with an Autonomous System (AS). Similar to the company object, the core data to populate the asn object originates from WHOIS data. For example, in order to find the corresponding information for ASN 36352, the WHOIS query whois -h whois.arin.net as36352 yields:\n\nWHOIS data such as the one from above is used to populate the asn object. For example, the OrgName (HostPapa) from the WHOIS record above is mapped to name attribute of the the asn object.\n\nThe asn object provides the following attributes:\n\nasn - int - The AS number (ASN)\nabuser_score - string - This field represents the quota of abusive IP addresses in all routes of the ASN. The higher this number is, the more abusive the whole ASN is.\nroute - string - The IP route (prefix) in CIDR network format\ndescr - string - An informational description of the AS\ncountry - string - The origin country of the AS (administratively)\nactive - string - Whether the AS is active (active means that there is at least one route administered by the AS)\norg - string - The organization (Based on WHOIS data) responsible for this AS\ndomain - string - The domain of the organization to which this AS belongs\nabuse - string - The email address to which abuse complaints for this organization should be sent (Based on WHOIS data)\ntype - string - The type for this ASN, this is either hosting, education, government, banking, business or isp\ncreated - string - When the ASN was established (Based on WHOIS data)\nupdated - string - The last time the ASN was updated (Based on WHOIS data)\nrir - string - To which Regional Internet Registry the ASN belongs administratively\nwhois - string - An url to the WHOIS information for this ASN\nFor inactive autonomous systems, most of the above information is not available.\n\n# The location object\nExample API output for the location object:\n\n"location": {\n  "continent": "NA",\n  "country": "United States",\n  "country_code": "US",\n  "state": "New York",\n  "city": "Buffalo",\n  "latitude": 42.886,\n  "longitude": -78.878,\n  "zip": "14205",\n  "timezone": "America/New_York",\n  "local_time": "2024-02-10T13:24:14-05:00",\n  "local_time_unix": 1707589454,\n  "is_dst": false\n},\nThe API provides geolocation information for the looked up IP address. The location object includes the following attributes:\n\ncontinent - string - The continent as two letter code such as NA for North America\ncountry - string - The full name of the country\ncountry_code - string - The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code to which the IP address belongs. This is the country specific geolocation of the IP address.\nstate - string - The state / administrative area for the queried IP address\ncity - string - The city to which the IP address belongs\nlatitude - float - The geographical latitude for the IP address\nlongitude - float - The geographical longitude for the IP address\nzip - string - The zip code for this IP\ntimezone - string - The timezone for this IP\nlocal_time - string - The local time for this IP in human readable format\nlocal_time_unix - int - The local time for this IP as unix timestamp\nis_dst - boolean - Whether daylight saving time (DST) is active in the geographical region of this IP address\nother - array - (Optional) - If there are multiple possible geographical locations, the attribute other is included in the API response.

                "OK now, pelase explain this post simply and consisely, like to an investor:\n$ABNB CEO on GenAI and innovation: \n\n\"But I think one of the things we've learned over the last, say, 18 months or nearly 2 years -- 22 months since ChatGPT launched, is that it's going to take a lot longer than people think for applications to change. If I were to think of AI, I'd probably think about it in 3 layers. You have the chip, you have the model and you have the applications. There's been a lot of innovation on the chip, there's been a lot of innovation on the model. We have a lot of new models and there's a prolific rate of improvement in these models. But if you look at your home screen, which of your apps are fundamentally different because of the AI, like fundamentally different because of generative AI? Very little, especially even less in e-commerce or travel. And the reason why is, I think it's just going to take time to develop new AI [Audio Gap] And so all of our paradigms are pre-AI paradigms. And so what we need to do is we need to actually develop AI applications that are native to the model. No one has done this yet. There's not been one app that I'm aware of. That's the top 50 app in the app store in the United States that is a fundamentally new paradigm as fundamentally different as a multitouch was to the iPhone in 2008, and we need that interface change. So that's one of the things that we're working on. And I do think Airbnb will eventually be much more than a search box where you type of destination, ad dates and find the listing. It's going to be much more of a travel concierge, it's having a conversation, learning, adapting to you. it's going to take a number of years to develop this. And so it won't be in the next year that this will happen. And I think this is probably what most of my tech friends are also saying, is this going to just take a bit more time. But to answer your question on what's possible, a new interface paradigm would allow us to attach new businesses. So the question is, what permission do we have to go into a business like hotels? Well, today, we have permission because we have a lot of traffic. But if we had a breakthrough interface, we have even more permission because suddenly, we could move top of funnel and not just ask where are you going, but we can point to -- we can inspire where you travel. And  an index of the world's communities. We told you we had information about every community, and we can provide the end-to-end trip for you. So there's a lot of opportunities as we develop new interfaces to cross-sell new more inventory. And just to remind everyone, we own hotel, we bought that before the pandemic. It's one of the most popular hotel booking apps in the world, and we are still investing in hotels. So absolutely, there are opportunities down the road with this new interface to sell new things, including hotels and everything.\"\n\n",
