                "OK now, pelase explain this post simply and consisely, like to an investor:\n$ABNB CEO on GenAI and innovation: \n\n\"But I think one of the things we've learned over the last, say, 18 months or nearly 2 years -- 22 months since ChatGPT launched, is that it's going to take a lot longer than people think for applications to change. If I were to think of AI, I'd probably think about it in 3 layers. You have the chip, you have the model and you have the applications. There's been a lot of innovation on the chip, there's been a lot of innovation on the model. We have a lot of new models and there's a prolific rate of improvement in these models. But if you look at your home screen, which of your apps are fundamentally different because of the AI, like fundamentally different because of generative AI? Very little, especially even less in e-commerce or travel. And the reason why is, I think it's just going to take time to develop new AI [Audio Gap] And so all of our paradigms are pre-AI paradigms. And so what we need to do is we need to actually develop AI applications that are native to the model. No one has done this yet. There's not been one app that I'm aware of. That's the top 50 app in the app store in the United States that is a fundamentally new paradigm as fundamentally different as a multitouch was to the iPhone in 2008, and we need that interface change. So that's one of the things that we're working on. And I do think Airbnb will eventually be much more than a search box where you type of destination, ad dates and find the listing. It's going to be much more of a travel concierge, it's having a conversation, learning, adapting to you. it's going to take a number of years to develop this. And so it won't be in the next year that this will happen. And I think this is probably what most of my tech friends are also saying, is this going to just take a bit more time. But to answer your question on what's possible, a new interface paradigm would allow us to attach new businesses. So the question is, what permission do we have to go into a business like hotels? Well, today, we have permission because we have a lot of traffic. But if we had a breakthrough interface, we have even more permission because suddenly, we could move top of funnel and not just ask where are you going, but we can point to -- we can inspire where you travel. And  an index of the world's communities. We told you we had information about every community, and we can provide the end-to-end trip for you. So there's a lot of opportunities as we develop new interfaces to cross-sell new more inventory. And just to remind everyone, we own hotel, we bought that before the pandemic. It's one of the most popular hotel booking apps in the world, and we are still investing in hotels. So absolutely, there are opportunities down the road with this new interface to sell new things, including hotels and everything.\"\n\n",

                "Here's a concise summary for an investor:\n\n**Airbnb's CEO sees significant potential in GenAI but emphasizes it's a long-term play.**\n\n* **Current AI applications are limited:** While there's been progress in AI chips and models, few existing apps are fundamentally different due to generative AI.\n* **New interface paradigms are needed:**  Airbnb is developing AI applications that are native to the model, aiming for a shift in user experience akin to the iPhone's multitouch interface revolution.\n* **Airbnb's future vision:**  A travel concierge that goes beyond search, offering a conversational and personalized experience, inspiring travel and providing end-to-end trip planning.\n* **New interface unlocks new opportunities:** This breakthrough would expand Airbnb's reach and allow them to cross-sell new services, including hotels (a market they're already invested in).\n\n**Key Takeaways for Investors:**\n\n* Airbnb recognizes the potential of GenAI but doesn't expect immediate impact.\n* Long-term investment is necessary for developing the necessary AI infrastructure.\n* The new interface paradigm has the potential to significantly expand Airbnb's business and market share.\n",
